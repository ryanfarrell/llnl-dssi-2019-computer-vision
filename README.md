## In this five-session course, I will present a carefully selected combination of classical and deep learning methods for a variety of visual data problems.  We will learn together about the following topics:
* Introduction to Visual Data - Visual data comes from diverse sources, has myriad representations and can be analyzed in many different ways.
* Advanced Clustering and its Applications - Clustering is an important method for dealing with big data, but there are many nuances in how this is best done.
* Metric Learning and Alternate Representations - Particularly with high-dimensional data, distance metrics, including those learned by supervision, can help us to distinguish the impediments from the important parts of our data.
* Data Visualization - In this era of deep-learning, one of the most important things that a data scientist can do is to spend time looking deeply at their data.
* The Categorization Spectrum - In this final session, we will discuss the spectrum of recognition, beginning with basic-level objects like cars, trees and people and focusing in on the often long-tailed/data-limited problems of fine-grained recognition and biometrics.
